//The Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript is a programming interface that 
//allows developers to interact with, manipulate, and modify the structure, style,
// and content of an HTML or XML document dynamically. It represents the document as
// a tree-like structure of objects where each node corresponds to an element, attribute,
// text, or other part of the document.
