<!--In HTML, selectors are patterns used to select and style 
    elements on a web page using CSS. Selectors can be simple 
    or complex and allow you to target specific HTML elements 
    based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and more.
    
    In HTML, a property typically refers to a CSS property, 
    which is a characteristic or attribute that defines how 
    an HTML element is styled and rendered on a webpage. 
    Each CSS property controls a specific aspect of the 
    element’s appearance or behavior, such as its color, 
    size, spacing, font, or layout.
