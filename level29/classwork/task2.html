<!--In HTML, an event refers to an action or occurrence that happens in the web browser
    which the browser can respond to. Events are typically triggered by user interactions
    with the web page, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or hovering over an
    element. Events can also be triggered by the browser itself, such as when a page finishes loading.-->
